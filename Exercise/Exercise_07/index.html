    <h1>HTML debugging examples</h1>

    <p>What causes errors in HTML?
        <ul>
            <li>Unclosed elements: If an element is <strong>not closed properly, then its effect can spread to areas you didn't intend</strong></li>

            <li>Badly nested elements: Nesting elements properly is also very important for code behaving correctly. <strong>strong <em>strong emphasised?</em></strong> what is this?</li>

            <li>Unclosed attributes: Another common source of HTML problems. Let's look at an example:
                <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/">link to Mozilla homepage</a></li>
        </ul>
